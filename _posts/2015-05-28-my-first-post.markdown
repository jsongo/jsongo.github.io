	This is my first post using github online. Exciting, isn't it.
	Amazing that markdown in github support tab key indent mode. Much helpful.
	But I've got to say that, you could not learn anything from this post. This is just a test. But if you'd rather be as boring as me, keep on. I'll talk about what I've got in mind now.


	I live in China where the internet is sometimes blocked by GFW. So I've got to surf the net with the shadowsocks(ss for short) running which redirect my visiting through GFW over SSL encrypted tunnels. I make it by a droplet in linode which runs a ss server. There's a saying going like that, you're only a stupid in China unless you know how to pass through the GFW. So, that's the way I surf the net. And it's nothing, you know, just nonsense.
	I love coding. Not only 'cause it could make me a living, but most of meaning of my life. It could do everything you can imagine, as well as those you cannot. It supplies me much fun.
