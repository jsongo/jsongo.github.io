&nbsp;Every time I drink too much , things appear in my mind are all expressed in En. I don&rsquo;t know why. Since middle high school, My English is always the best in the whole grade. I love speaking it, using it. But I&rsquo;ve no Idea why I would do that. Many of my high school diaries are written in En, event the daily schedules.


&nbsp;Now I&rsquo;ve work for near two years. I don&rsquo;t have much interest in reading it, but speaking it.

&nbsp;I have much thoughts in my mind. I don&rsquo;t like to work all day long, just for living, and what&rsquo;s worse, for other people. Every one has the right to decide how he or she lives, poor or rich, it&rsquo;s not others who can control. It&rsquo;s you. Your fate depends only on yourself. I don&rsquo;t like spending much time wondering how far I can go in such situation. Change it, if you don&rsquo;t like. And this theory also fits yourself, if you don&rsquo;t like the current self, then change it.

&nbsp;We all have to leave, whatever the surrounding we&rsquo;ve got used to, or the people we&rsquo;re much familiar with. People are always afraid to change, or to translate to the situation one is strange to. We&rsquo;d like to stay the same. Until someday it turns to be a worse one that makes you angry or disappointed. But I don&rsquo;t like it, at least on things I can change. People don&rsquo;t often believe that they can, until someday they were forced to make it. Actually we&rsquo;re all born to be talented, it&rsquo;s just us who don&rsquo;t believe it. For example, the first time I drive in expressway, I don&rsquo;t believe it at first, I&rsquo;m not confident in it. I event never think about that till a few days ago, I drove the car I&rsquo;d rent onto the expressway. I didn&rsquo;t think too much about that, just rushing to the destination. And 3 hours later, I made it. If you asked me the question whether I dare to a few days ago, my answer must be 'eh, let me think for a while', after which you would get the &lsquo;no&rsquo;. So don&rsquo;t think too much, just do it. The more you think, the more afraid you&rsquo;ll be.
